# Advent of Code Programming Challenge 2022

These are my solutions for the great [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) programming challenge. 

Everything has been written with the sole purpose of solving the challenge as quickly as I was able to. This repository is not meant to be a display of good programming practice, most efficient algorithms, or cool obfuscation skills.

The most difficult levels to me were [9b](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/9), [12a](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/12), [16a](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/16), [19](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/19), [22b](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/22). I've solved [17b](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/17) with the calculator and I didn't even preserve the first few levels as those were almost too trivial to complete using `sed`, `awk` and friends.

While this is throw-away quality code, I still found it a bit sad to be actually thrown away, so it is now ending up right here on GitHub ;-)
